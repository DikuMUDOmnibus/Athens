PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills available to you.  You can check this anywhere.
 
PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum 75%, any more 
improvement in the skill is done by using the skill.  You must be at a 
guild master to practice.
 
GAIN LIST will list any skills that you can learn at that location.

GAIN with an argument will teach you the first lesson of a skill.

The higher your memory and reasoning, the more you will learn at each 
practice session.  The total number of bonuses from all the stats on 
the `#`YRIGHT COLUMN`^ of your attributes determines the numbers of 
practices you gain per level.  Unused sessions are saved until you 
do use them.
 
Bonuses < 50  = 3 Pracs
Bonuses < 100 = 4 Pracs
Bonuses < 150 = 5 Pracs
Bonuses < 200 = 6 Pracs
 
`#`WBonuses`^ are those numbers by your attribute. They can be negative 
or positive. Here are examples:
 
Co: 30( 47)/ -5
Sd: 35( 57)/+10
 
The bonus to Co is `#`W-5`^ and to Sd is `#`W+10`^.

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class and race, and
several initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).
 
It takes two training sessions to improve an attribute from 1-15%, or to
increase your mana or hp.  You receive two training sessions per level.
 
e.g train st (Increases your strength.)
 
There are usually trainers in gyms, military buildings, stadiums, ect.
 
It is important to note that you must use TRAINING sessions to gain a new 
skills - using gain (skill).

The skill animal-training is the ability for the seasoned player to
break in all but the most unruly of creatures to be ridden.  Of 
course, the creature in question must first be rideable (no use trying 
to break in a snake if you can't actually ride it). This skill differs 
somewhat from domesticate as it doesn't make the animal yours to order
how you like.  It WILL make the animal more docile, and once broken, 
that animal can be ridden by anyone.  Beware, if you don't keep an 
eye on your mount it will wander off.

see_also POULTICE MORTAR~
text `=lSyntax:`=? herbalism cauldron|mortar
 
Herbalism is the ancient art of combining herbs to form powerful 
potions and poultices.
The first step to creating a new potion is to collect the necessary
components.  The herbs are gathered by using the `Wforage`=? skill.  
The type of herbs located while foraging is dependent on the 
landscape, the season, and the time of day.  Above and beyond 
these limitations, some herbs are simply rarer than others.  
These are often prized by pharmacists for their powerful properties, 
and are worth their weight in gold.
 
To practice this complex art, the herbalist must have a `Wmortar`=? or a 
`Wcauldron`=? in which to combine the herbs.  A mortar is a bowl-shaped 
apparatus used in conjunction with a pestle, a heavy stone or wooden 
device used to grind herbs, yielding poultices and salves which can 
be applied later.  A cauldron is used in brewing herbal mixtures which 
are ingested, be it eaten or sipped.
 
The ingredients to be mixed are placed in the proper container, and 
then combined.  If the measurements were correct, the mixture might 
yield beneficial results.  Be warned, however, carelessly mixing herbs 
together can often have deadly consequences, or in the very least,
waste precious herbs.
 
An example of how to use the herbalism skill:
 
`Yput root in mortar
`cYou put a bitter root in a tiny mortar and pestle.
