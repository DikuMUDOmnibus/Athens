the people with [NSP] next to their names or ask an immortal.  `+
 `+
`s6. `=? Do not exploit bugs or cheat in any kind of way.  If you find a bug type 
`Ybug`=? or if it is a serious promlem `Ynote to imm`=?.  If you abuse a bug you may

`+
`s9. `=? Be mindful of other people's feelings when rping.  `+
`+
`s10. `=? Do not kill assist, which means weaken a mob for someone else to kill 
it for experience.  Healing and casting protective spells on them is fine 
but do not hurt a mob to near death for someone else to gain the experience 
points. Weakening a mob with spells is not allowed as well.
`+
`s11. `=? Do not STEAL or PKILL a Link Dead player or `g[AFK]`=? player.  If you see 
them `Y[LD]`=? assume these players are not there.  (`Yhelp linkdead`=?).  `+

plazas, nor cast utterdark on them.`+
`+
`s16. `=?Using automated emotes or says are permited to enhance roleplaying,  but 
not in a way with the purpose of abusing the autoxp systems.  Aliasing 
socials to emotes while technically allowed if not able to be considered 
spammy will most often reduce the amount of RPS you get.`+
`+
`c----------------------------------`+
`cMultilogging/Equipment Exchange:`=?`+
`s17. `=? Do not Multilog at all at any time.  This means having TWO or more 
characters on at the SAME TIME.  You may create more than one character, but 
you must quit before logging with the other.  Type `YQUIT`=? to log out.  Being 
Link Dead `Y[LD]`=? and logging on with another character is counted as 
"multilogging".  `+
-NB.  If you use a network that has two people or more on it logging on from 
the same address `Ynote to law`=? before you and your friend log on so you have 
clearance!  `+

`+
`s19. `=? Do not give your character password to anyone.  `+
`+

classed as "multilogging".  Penalties can include deletion and/or a site 
ban.  `+
`+
`s21. `=? Exchanging equipment and/or money between your characters is forbidden. 
This includes (but not necessarily limited to) dropping equipment/money with 
one char, logging off then picking it up with another char of yours... or 
giving an object to another player to give to your low level character (this 
is called equipment exchange).  All players involved in these actions will 
suffer the consquences, these include deletion of all characters involved 
and possibly banning depending on the situation.`+
`+
`c----------------------------------`+
`cPkilling behaviour:`=?`+
`s22. `=? Do not bring in your high-level character to pkill someone who was 
involved with your low-level character.  If you have more than one 
character, they never met IC, and do not know each other.  Your characters 
being brothers is not an excuse.  If you do it your high level character 
will be deleted.  `+
`+
`s23. `=? ALL pkills `RMUST`=? have a decent amount of RP preceeding the pkill event.`+
`+
`s24. `=? ALL pkills must have an In charcter basis (`Yhelp pk-reasons`=?).  `+
`+
 * "He stole from me and I instantly slayed him" is NOT a valid pkill 
reason.  `+
 * "I am -3 -3 alignment and I'm evil" is not valid reason.  `+
 * "I hate all gods" is not a valid reason.  `+
`+
`s25. `=? Do not get into a pkill fight within 10 minutes of logging on, this

stealing and/or trying to get someone to pkill you.  `+

purpose of permanently killing a character results in harsh penalties.  `+
`+
`s27. `=? Do not purposely go Link Dead `Y[LD]`=? in a pkill fight.  `+
`+
 `c----------------------------------`+
`cClan Halls:`=?`+
`s28.  `=? Do not log out in someone else's clan hall unless you are on 100% 
peaceful terms with that clan!!!  `+
`+
`c----------------------------------`+
`cThe General Rules:`=?`+
`s29. `=? Respect Immortals they are there to help you.  If you receive an answer 
from one immortal do not go behind their back and ask a second immortal the 
same thing.  `+

keyword RP-POLICY~
level 1
category undefined~
text This is a list of Roleplaying laws that should be followed in this game.
 
- Mobs are as alive as any character is, those who are sentient, as sentient 
as your character. They are to be treated as such. You should use your 
imagination, and ignore the fact that our code does not have artificial 
intelligence.
 
- Swears used in this game are not supposed to offend anyone who is playing 
the game. Do not use low level language. Create new, colorful swears, like 
'you pile of rotten pig ears!'. Penalties will be applied.
 
- Alignments should not flicker. They are anchored to the depths of your 
character's soul. If you feel your rp is not in accord with your alignment, 
read 'help alignment-change' and note the Roleplay Council.
 
- The only language that should be used here, in character, is english. 
French, German, or whatever other earth language do not exist here, and 
should not be used.
 
Mobs and pets should not be equipped with things they shouldn't be
able to wear, `#`Weven if the code allows it`^. Things like turtles wearing 
rings, horses holding swords, crabs wearing plate mails are deeply frowned 
upon.

and any resonable punishment is considered fair.  This your first last and

keyword AREA-REQUIREMENTS~
level 92

text . 
`#`WArea Requirements`^
 
- In order of implementing an area, there is a minimum number or rooms that 
are required. Depending on how powerful the items on the area will be, the 
number of required rooms change. The reason is that powerful items will 
be better protected. The following table shows the relation between items 
and rooms:
 
    Kind of Area         Rooms
 
    Simple items         15 +
    Good items           30 +
    Powerful items       50 +
 
  To know the kind of items your area has, check Table 2 on the Object Balance 
Section of the Builder's Manual. The table lists 3 levels of equipment level:
 
    `#`Wnormal
    with one alliance flag or the magic flag
    with 2 alliances flags and the magic flag`^
 
  What determines the kind of your area is the kind of items your main mobs will 
be wearing.
 
  Main mobs are those that rule the area, or the most powerful mobs in the 
area. Examples: main mobs in Mekali are the guard captain and the shopkeepers; 
in the Training Fields, it is the Absent General.
 
- The area must have an internal organization. There should be a hierarchy 
(who rules?), an economy (what do they eat? Where does that come from?), and 
facilities (where do the poor guards sleep? not to mention toilets, 
kitchen...). Your area could be an exception for some of the above mentioned 
organization, but hardly to all of them.
  Examples of non-aggressive areas you can use as a comparison:
    - facilities: 
       good example: Silver Temple, Brigand Camp
       bad example: Training Fields
    - hierarchy:
       good example: Training Fields, Orcish Fortress, Mrem Tree, Brigand Camp.
       bad example: City of Lost Winds
 
- You are expected to write a small help file (one paragraph is enough), 
describing the history and organization of your area. This file will be 
imm-only and is OOC.
 
- If you want to add an item with a mythos, history, diary, you must submit 
your text to the Roleplay Council.
 
- You should read the mythos related to any race you are using in your area. 
If your group will be radically different from the general individuals of that 
race, you must report that to the Roleplay Council. That means that if you 
want an area of orcs that will be angels, you must discuss that with Roleplay.

keyword SKILL-ABUSE-POLICY~
level 1
category undefined~
text Abusing skills or spells by spamming their command in an attempt to get your 
skills percentage increased is not allowed.  This means sitting in one place 
and repeatedly typing the skill command for no better reason than to get 
better at the skill.  Anyone caught doing this will likely find their skill 
removed or minimally, set back to 1 depending on circumstances.  There will 
also be a minor experience penalty.  Increasing a skills percentage through 
natural and non-spammy use is fine.

category undefined~
text `#`BCOMMAND     COMMENT
-------     -------`^
 
`#`ySLAY`^        Slay can have an ic use in a few specific situations: if a death is 
            required, and a pkill fight won't fit (like a ritual); if a player 
            is to meet certain death, from which he shouldn't have a chance to 
            flee (like when a divine lighting falls from the sky).
 
`#`yPDISABLE`^    Usually there is no need for disabling a mortal's command, for the 
            sake of rp. Just sending a tell 'You are mute now, rp it' should 
            be enough. In the case of a disable that should last longer, 
            though, pdisable could be useful. In this case, `#`Ymake sure you 
            speak to the player prior to disabling the command`^. (NOSAY, 
            NOEMOTE fall into this case).
 
`#`yFORCE`^       This can be most fun, for it can bring some surprises to the player. 
            Once again, though, `#`Ymake sure you speak to the player prior to 
            doing this`^.
 
`#`yTRANSFER`^    Although tempting, transfer should not be used when switched into a 
            mob that does not have that power (like Mekali's laborers :p).
 
`#`yLOAD`^        Same as above. A god can 'create a buquet of roses'. Mekali's jewler
            can 'create a beautiful necklace'. But most mobs can't.
 
`#`yPURGE`^       Same thing. Just use common sense.

keyword **PK-REASONS~
level 1
category undefined~
text .. 
`#`WPK REASONS
 
`rStrong ones:
------ ----`^
 
These are reasons that can justify a pkill by themselves.
 
- being pkilled (if a group attacked you that's reason enough to kill all the 
  group).
- being killed - cases such as a charmed mob killing you at the order of a 
  player.
- a cool rp situation - mind you, a true rp situation - like someone stealing 
your girlfriend, or a court plot.
- being payed to do so - `#`YNote:`^ this is a special case. The killer doesn't 
need any other reasons, but the employer does.
- your friend was killed - `#`YNote:`^ in which case, your friend will no longer 
have a reason to pkill his murderer.
 
`#`bMild ones:
---- ----`^
 
Here are the reasons which, by themselves, `#`Rdo not`^ justify a pkill, but if 
joined, might. Note that some reasons will weight more than others. An example: 
being teleported counts more than a spit. Usually, though, more than two of 
these reasons will be needed to justify a pkill.
 
- invasion of your clan.
- invasion of your house.
- spitting, swearing, general harrassment.
- being teleported, slept.
- being stolen.
- killing innocent people (mobs).
 
`#`CNotes:
 
`s1.`c the nobles and immortals reserve the right to judge each situation 
independently, and to change the afford mentioned reasons, as they seem fit.
 
`s2.`c All the above reasons are subject to your alignment. A +3/+3, for example 
would not kill for any of the above, but he might rescue a little child who's 
is being attacked.
 
`s3.`c Once you pkill someone, `Call`c your pkreasons are reseted. That is, you 
won't have any reason left to pkill the same person again. Even if you had 
1,000 reasons, 1 pkill eliminates them all. You can only think of pkilling the 
same person if that person gives you brand new reasons.
 
`s4.`c Suspicions are `Cnot`c good pk-reasons. All your reasons must be concrete, 
ie, you must be able to prove them if asked.`^

- Swear words in any language are not allowed.
- Religious names of any Earthly religion are not allowed.
- Be creative. Do not give your character the name of another character you
  like in a fantasy book.
- Do not give your char a descriptive name such as CoolGuy, SexyJane, 
  WeaponMaster or GreatFighter.
- Do not put nouns, adjectives or adverbs. If a word has a meaning, keep it 
  off your name. Examples: Slasher, TheShadow, RedDrac, Bloody.
- Do not put titles in your name such as SirCrosash or LadyElbriana
- Do not try to get around these rules by naming yourself incorrectly and 
  just changing some letters, like Dchadow or Kreizie.
- The immortal staff reserves the right to change your name if it is 
  disrespectful, in bad role-playing form, or in violation of any of the 
  above rules.

text `cNETSEX means using graphic descriptions of parts and feelings to portray a sexual encounter.
 
While we do NOT approve of NETSEX we are NOT going to activly seek
out and punish those who engage in it. Anyone caught doing this in
a public location WILL be punished severly. `RCONSENTING`X `cadults
caught engaged in netsex in a private setting will be left alone so
long as it remains consenting.
 
RAPE defined according to Merriam Webster
(http://www.merriamwebster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary):
 
Unlawful sexual activity and usually (but not always) sexual intercourse
carried out forcibly or under threat of injury against the will usually
(but not always) of a female or with a person who is beneath a certain
age or incapable of valid consent.
 
Yes, this means anyone caught involved in netsex with a person under the
age of consent will be treated as having raped that person. For our purposes
"age of consent" is defined as a person of at least 18 years of age or legally
emmancipated by their parent or guardian (legal proof that would hold up in a
court of law must be produced to prove this). No questions asked and no exceptions.
 
RAPE is STRICTLY forbidden and will almost always lead to deletion and/or site
ban when proof of the actions are given to an Admin. This is your first, last,
and ONLY warning.
 
Sexual Harassment on this Mud is not tolerated in any way either. 
It is not acceptable nor will it ever be.
 
Sexual Harassment is:
 
1) Using sexual language to someone that doesn't wish to have you speaking to
them, in that way.
 
2) Using any sexual emotes without permission to do so. (french, fondle, etc,
this does not mean things like flirt or stare)
 
3) Stalking players with sexual undertones to the style as compared to shadowing
someone to pkill them (Any time there is question as to the undertones of
stalking/shadowing it is up to the punising Immortal to decide for him or herself
the undertone to the actions).
 
Please people lets not do anything here to someone that we wouldn't do in Real Life.
As far as I know Frenching and Fondling someone you don't know is not acceptable
behavior in any world. Punishment for Harassment ranges from a warning to deletion
and permanant siteban - no warnings necessary either so don't be surprised. 
   
If you have been Sexually Harassed Please do the following:
1) Ask the person to stop.
 
2) Leave the room the person is in. They can't emote to you if you are not there.
 
3) Tell someone - or discuss it with an immortal, ask on ooc for one if you cant
see any on the who list. Perhaps if your asking them to stop didn't stop it,
someone else asking will let them know you are serious.
 
4) Tell an immortal what is going on so we know who is doing these things.
 
If anyone has the need for clarification of any of these rules, write a note to
an admin... A common saying applies to all the rules on Athens, and that is to read
the "spirit of the law" not the "letter of the law".  If it might offend then it is
most likely not appropriate.

keyword CHEAT CHEATING CHEATERS~
title Cheating~
category undefined~
text Cheating is a very seriously taken matter on Athens.  The following are a 
few examples of types of activities that will not be tolerated here.
 
Asking Immortals for special favors, information that your character has no 
way of knowing, equipment, restores, boons, ect.
 
Asking other players in OOC ways about IC information, such as where 
equipment and mobiles are and how to complete quests.  You need to ask this 
information IC.
 
Example:
 
BAD:
You chat: 'Anyone know where I can get some good xp?'
=Jason chats=-: 'Yeah, that Cyclops 2 rooms south of the Cave is good.'
 
 
 
 
Good:
 
In Melda's Diner:
You ask 'Does anyone know of a monster that a hero like myself can find?'
Ajax says 'I heard a rumor about a monster as tall as a giant…'
Ajax says 'With just one eye in the very center of his forehead.'
Jason says 'I've seen that horrid thing down by the sea caves.'
Jason says 'If you really want to find it, I'd start there.'
 
Multi-playing is not allowed.  It offers too many opportunities for 
cheating.  It is against the rules of this mud to give one of your 
characters equipment, money, items, ect from another one of your characters.  
This could be done by multi-playing and directly handing the item to your 
other character, having your character drop or leave something somewhere for 
your other character to pick up later, or asking another player to hold an 
item for your other character to get from them later.  This sort of cheating 
is completely intolerable and will be punished very harshly.  The 
recommended action for those caught doing this is deletion of both 
characters.  A third party involved will also be punished.
 

Exploiting bugs, or other problems with the mud's code rather than reporting 
them is a serious form of cheating.  If you notice that something peculiar 
or strange has occurred to your character or those around you, make sure to 
type `RBUG (WHAT THE ISSUE IS)`c.  This will alert the mud staff that there is 
an issue and they will work on fixing it as soon as possible.`x
