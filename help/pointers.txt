text Here is an example of a long description.  For this example, we will use the 
goddess Eris: `+

She is fairly unremarkable, with tangled dark hair falling across her 
exceedingly pale face, and seems not to care a whit about her appearance.  
Her eyes seem to hold a mystery all their own, glinting mischievously, and 
she carries herself with the force of a whirlwind - always in the midst of 
the trouble.  `+

Your description should never include the clothes you are wearing, but 
should give detail about your physical appearance - for example, more detail 
about hair and eye color.

keyword EXAMPLE-HISTORY HISTORY-EXAMPLE~
category undefined~
text An example history is: `+
`+
Agapios is a well-spoken, benevolent man from Megara.  He is often quiet, 
and only speaks when he believes he can improve upon the silence.  He is 
generally good, although at times he can be quite wiley.  He is known to be 
a very kind man, always helping those in need who ask for his assistance.  
Agapios is often wise, but there are times when he has his moments of 
unrest.  `+
`+
Born to two young slaves in Megara, Agapios claims the city Megara herself 
as his mother.  His parents have since passed on from this world and have 
found their way to the Elysium Fields, he hopes.  They each died when he was 
quite young and he lived on the streets as a child, begging for money and 
food.  As he grew older, he found a fancy for the seas.  He is determined to 
become a sailor of the deep seas and victor of the ancient isles which have 
been lost at sea.  He wishes to bring the beauty and wonder of far places to 
the glorious Megara, and take the literature, culture and rich textiles of 
Megara to those far off lands.  Agapios has always been a hard worker, 
knowing his work may find him the favor of the gods or even get him closer 
to his dream of sailing the seas.  `+
`+
Follower of Zeus, Agapios believes all laws are to be followed and takes 
this role very seriously.  He aspires to be an officer in the police force 
of Megara, to lead the city in the ways of all things noble and true.  He 
takes great heed of his god and is always watching the sky for thunderbolts 
hurled from the heights of Mount Olympus.  `+
