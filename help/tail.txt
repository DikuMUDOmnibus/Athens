text Messages printed across the screen when tracking NPC'S, PC'S..  This will 
refer to the current listing of races in NPCEDIT.  It will cover all 10 
directions when tracking someone and be based on weight of the character by 
using RSIZE and the RACE of the character, whether be NPC or PC.  `1`1Weight Table`1============`1deeply`1heavily`1fairly`1lightly`1faintly`1`1Time Table`1==========`1extremely new`1very new`1rather new`1moderately new`1fairly new`1fairly old`1moderately old`1rather old`1very old`1extremely old`1faintly visible`1barely visible`1`1Diagnostics of Print-Outs for tracking example 1{}A set of [Time]

give better descriptions on the track your tracking.  Say if your tracking 
an orc.  Each room you walk in you see for example: A set of extremely new 
footprints of an orc lead towards the east.  You can then type Analyze track 
and it will analyze the tracks of which your currently tracking, in this 
example typing analyze track you will see something like These tracks are 
deeply imprinted into the ground.  Chart system below: `1`1These tracks are [weight] into the [sector]

text It was a frosty morn on the Month of Frost Blight 1218AK. On the day of 
despair oh so fitting was a time that led to my death. I was preparing for a 
class within the Mages Academy around 7am. I reached over and put down a 
ghost like tiara given to me by whom I was told was Suhl. I suppose I should 
start with the whole story...
 
I have two loves, Traolin and Ariaken, my heart is between them both and I 
hath confessed a love beyond imagining to both. Judge me as thou wilt I was 
out but two weeks ago in an open field, all three of us were there 
discussing a perculiar draconian who would not leave Trao alone, he was a 
funny sort- but I stray from my story. I lifted my head and in silent 
prayer, i prayed to Lanthos to give me strength to make choice between my 
loves.
 
At that moment a gaunt shadowy figure appeared before us and proclaimed not 
either deserved my love and he bestowed a betrothal gift apon me, a tiara 
that dazzled mine eye with it's beauty, so much in fact I became unaware of 
my actions for a short time.
 
What took place next was I was fussed over and they both feared for my 
safety - quite flattering dont you think? When Ariaken told Traolin just 
exactly why he called me his love he was unmistakably upset. Traolin did not 
know I felt as strongly for the dark knight who I hath grown so fond of 
these past weeks. He immediately stormed off, his passions ripping him to 
shreds no doubt for I saw it in his eyes.
 
This morning, he gated to me, we argued and he used fairly rough treatment, 
I wept and looked deeply into his eyes but for consequence had it he found 
not the heart this time to forgive me. He asked me to come with him for he 
sent me a parchment previously he was being hunted for his foul deeds 
towards Endomar and the Academy of Magic. I followed him obediantly outside 
into the cold bitting air of the morning where we walked briskly for a few 
miles arguing. It got to the point where he griped my arm and shook me 
violently, I returned a stare full of hate and love at the same time, I 
admit I do still truely love him beyond anything imaginable - and Lanthos 
strike me down if I feel otherwise.
 
He charmed me and from what I remember his voice softened its edge, looking 
into mine eyes he promised me that he would set me free and in doing so 
touched my cheek and sent me to a dreamland. After that I felt the essence 
of my being slip away and my heart slow down. I was unconscience and before 
I could wake from my slumber I had a dagger plunged lovingly into mine 
chest. I awoke painlessly, red essence streaming from my heart, I crawled on 
my hands and knees a fair distance away from him before he delivered me into 
eternal sleep.
 
I forgive Traolin and love him for the hate, for the love, and for 
deliverance.
