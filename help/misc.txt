text At some point in time, a character may want or need and alignment change.  
There can be several reasons for this.  Something might happen in the 
characters life that changes his view of the world, the player might decide 
that he is having a hard time with his chosen alignment, or the imms and 
nobles might determine that a character is not playing by the rules of their 
chosen alignment.  `+
`+
Although players may change alignment, it is not something that should be 
approached lightly, since there are serious consequences.  When a character 
changes alignment, he does more than just change his attitudes.  He is 
altering his perception of the world and his relationship to it.  Much of 
what he learned previously was flavored by his alignment.  When the 
philosophical foundations of his life change, the character discovers that 
he must relearn things he thought he knew.  Because of these reasons, any 
alignment changes that occur will result in a small experience reduction.  
This experience loss is not to penalize the character or saying that the 
player has done something bad or not role-playing properly, but is the 
result of the characters changed perception of the world.  The amount of 
experience lost will be determined by the immortals and is dependent on how 
drastic the alignment change is.  There will be no exceptions to this rule.  
`+
`+
If you think that you want an alignment change, you will be informed of the 
amount of experience that will be lost before the change and will have the 
option of proceeding or not.  If you decide not to change your alignment, 
you must continue to role-play your original alignment according to the 
guidelines found in the corresponding help files.  `+
`+
If you want to request an alignment change for your character, you must:
 
- Write the story behind it. That means the IC reasons behind the change. 
These reasons must be sent to the histories mailing list (help `=_email), 
and must have at least around `#`B200 words`^.  If your character is 
changing, then he probably has a nice story behind that change.
 
An immortal will get back to you letting you know what the cost of the 
change will be.
