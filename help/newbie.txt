text ..                `#`GThe Athens Newbie Document`^
`+
Welcome to Athens.  This file is for new players, and for long time ones 
too.  For those that do not know what Athens has to offer, this will be a 
very useful document to read.  It will give you an idea of where Athens 
is,where it is going, and how you can fit in with everyone who already has 
the jump on you.  For more experienced players, it will serve to remind you 
of a few things you might have missed, or could use some brushing up on.  
Rolemaster Based Attributes - The attribute system for Athens is modled 
after the rolemaster role playing game.  If you are not familiar with 
rolemaster, don't worry.  Take a look at the help file for ATTRIBUTES and it 
will explain the ten attributes and how they effect your character.  The 
expanded number of attributes seems a bit daunting at first, but they allow 
for a greater realism in character abilities.  Before long they will seem no 
more confusing than more standard six attribute MUDs.  `+
`+
`#`CSEE: `=_ATTRIBUTES `=_CLASSES`^
`+
`+
Dynamic Mythos - The Gods of Athens are constantly updating and changing the 
game.  A story line is being followed, and from time to time, major events 
in Athens history occur.  Some times new zones are added, other times zones 
are rewritten to reflect what has been going on.  Other changes can occur 
based on player interaction.  Everyone has the potential to help craft the 
story line of Athens.  `+
`+
`#`CSEE:`^ `=_ROLEPLAY (and all associated help files)
`+
`+
Role playing has several different facets to it.  In terms of your 
character, you are described by several different catagories.  One of which 
is your race.  Race plays a big part of what your character is.  Each of the 
races of Athens speak Greek.  Race also plays a factor in who you consider a 
potential ally, or enemy.  If you are a citizen of Sparta, do you harbor any 
ill will toward those of Athens?  Or Corinth?  All questions are worth 
considering.  `+

`#`CSEE:`^ `=_RACE
`+
`+
Not only is your character marked by race, but by class.  Your class will 
dictate what gear you may use.  If you look at someone else and see them 
wearing the most beautiful robes in Greece, they are not likely a slave.  
Likewise, most demi-gods would not choose to be dressed in rags.  `+

text ..  The Athens Newbie Document, Part 2 
`c========---------------------------------------------========`=?  `+
`+
These two groups define the character in it's most general form.  There are 
however other distinctions that need to be considered.  One of these is your 
character's alignment.  How strongly they are influenced by good and evil, 
law or chaos will reflect many things about a character.  Who they will 
trust (if anyone), what gear they will use, whether or not they are likely 
to retrieve corpses for other players, what clans they will seek out to 
join, nobles.  `+
`+
`CSEE: `=_OOC `=_IC `=_RP`=?  `+
`+
`+
Your character is an individual.  You have your own view on the world, and 
how it should be.  How you take steps toward that end dictates ultimately 
what kind of a character you are.  All of the above items combine to form 
your character's outlook.  What kind of mobs does your character kill?  
Where does he or she choose to rest after a hard fought battle?  What skills 
do you want your character to develop first?  Next?  Not at all?  `+
`#`CSEE:`^ `=_HISTORY
`+
`+
Now, aside from role playing, there are certain parts of the game that 
cannot be avoided.  These are game mechanics and more or less what you have 
to do to level, and improve yourself.  Mostly, your character will improve 
through killing mobs.  Player killing IS allowed in Athens, after all, this 
is supposed to be as realistic as possible.  One word of warning is that if 
you kill another player for a non-IC reason, you will be punished by the 
nobles, the administration, or both.  Player killing is accepted, but not 
taken lightly.  `+
`+
`#`CSEE:`^ `=_IC `=_WHY `=_OOC `=_RP
`+
`+
Combat is level dependant in Athens.  That is to say, if you greatly out 
class your opponent in terms of level, you will more than likely defeat them 
very easily.  The opposite is also true.  If your intended kill out ranks 
you, you may want to rethink your actions.  Weapons also do damage that is 
dependant on thier type.  Daggers do the least amount of damage (all other 
factors being equal) and two handed axes do the most.  This should be self 
evident.  All players can wield a weapon, and hold one in thier off hand.  
While so armed, the character gains an extra (and ONLY one) attack with that 
secondary weapon.  While using a shield, holding an item, or wielding a two 
handed weapon, a secondary weapon cannot be used.  `+
`+
Armor in Athens will protect you based on how much of your body it covers.  
Items like neck armor protect comparatively little of you, whereas shields 
provide much better protection.  Whether or not your character uses a two 
handed weapon, two one handed weapons, or a weapon and a shield is totally 
up to you.  All three forms have thier advantages, and disadvantages.  `+
`+
Once you begin your character in Athens, you are encouraged to visit several 
areas to get a grasp of what you just got yourself into.  Firstly, and most 
obvious, is the Mud School.  Even experienced MUD players should invest the 
time to go through mud school.  The mobs there, and the refresher course in 
mudding are valuable to everyone.  `+
`+
Also, Athens has Newbie Town and Quest School available to explore.  These 
areas explain mudding on more general terms, both for game mechanics, and 
how it applies to Athens.  Everyone should definitely go through these 
areas.  To sum up, Athens is a unique game where those who want to spend the 
time and effort to build interesting, multi-dimentional characters have the 
opportunity to do so.  If this is your goal, then submit a character and get 
ready for a game you are not likely to soon forget.  `+

text Athens has a unique Mud School!  Virgil, the guide, will help you along the 
way as you explore through this school to learn about how to play in our 
game.  We also suggest that you look at the map you'll find in your 
inventory.  It shows all of Newbie Town, which is excellent for you to 
explore before you embark on your journey into Athens.  It is also a good 
idea to type 'help game', our main file for new players.

This command allows you to edit a characters long description, using the 
familiar description editor.  You can edit a characters long description 
using the character description command(chardesc).  It works exactly like 
the descript command (for yourself) apart from youtype the characters name 
as the single parameter.  You cannot edit a characters long description if 
they have been letgained.  Only an immortal can do this.  This command is 
specifically for helping those newbies that are absoultely new to RPing 
and/or the description editor. `+
`+
E.G. CHARDESC BOB will edit Bob's description. NOTE: The person is totally
unaware that you are editing his/her long description.  You might want to 
notify them that you are doing so, or else you'll both end up messing with 
the description at the same time.`+
`+
You can also edit a mobiles description for quests and things like that. 
Newbie support people are also able to edit descriptions of newbies.

text `cWelcome,`+
The following few help entries will introduce you to the basics of playing 
this game and get you up and running.`+
`+
In these helps, the text '`=lSyntax:`=?' is used to specify what you must type 
to activate a command, for example:`+
  `=lSyntax:`=? help `=_start-newbie`+
Means that you can type `=Chelp start-newbie`=? (which in this case is the 
command used to display this help entry.)`+
`+
When you view these helps please read them carefully and view associated 
help files, for example 'help `=_get' will also have help on the give command.`+
`+
Another way to figure out what all the commands do is to just type 
`=Ccommand`=?, this will list all of the commands you can use.  You can view a 
help on any of those commands by typing `=Chelp <command name>`=?.  e.g. if you 
type command and you see a command listed called give, type `=Chelp give`=? for 
help on what the command give actually does.`+

title What Now?~
category undefined~
see_also CHEAT~
text After talking with Virgil (and hopefully going through Athens’ mud and quest
schools), you may be asking yourself, "What now?"  This help file was 
created to help answer that question and get your character off to a good 
start.
 
The very first thing you should do is `RRECALL`c to Newbie Square if you’re not
there already.  From there you should go to the Training Room to Practice 
and Train yourself as much as possible.
 
After that, if you skipped mud school, you will want to go to the shop
located one south and then one east of the Newbie Square.  You’ll need the
equipment offered for sale there to protect yourself.
 
If you have your equipment purchased, make sure to type `RWEAR ALL`c to put it
on your body before proceeding on the trail south of Newbie Square.  The
trail branches off into two directions.  The western path has very easy
mobiles to kill, so take that one first.  `RCONSIDER (MOBILE)`c to see your
chances of beating it in a fight.  Simply `RKILL (MOBILE)`c to start a fight
with it.  If you win, you will gain experience points.  After gaining a
level, make sure to head to the eastern side of the trail to gain more
experience.  After you gain level 6, you will not be a newbie any longer.
 
Once you have lost newbie status, your `RRECALL`c will take you to your city’s
recall point.  From there, it is best for you to explore, find mobiles to
`RCONSIDER`c and possibly `RKILL`c.  You will want to keep a sharp eye out for
quests and puzzles as you explore.  Group Contests are listed under the
command `RCONTESTS`c.   Feel free to join any of these contests to gain
yourself points and other rewards that will help your character.  There
will be oppertunities to interact and roleplay with other characters.
It's never too early to start learning how to act IC.
 
Please note that the immortals WILL NOT tell you where mobiles, equipment
and quests are located.  It’s against our own rules to do so and is
cheating.  You also should not ask other players for this information in
OOC ways, such as in the chat lounge or over channels.
