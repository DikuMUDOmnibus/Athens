excellent IC way to role-play your characters' religious needs.
 
Syntax: 
`Rpray (message)`c  -Sends a pray to all the gods
        Jason types: pray I wish for world peace.
        The gods would see:  Jason prays, "I wish for world peace."
`Rpray (god), (message)`c  -Prays to a specifically addressed god
        Helen types: pray Hera, I wish for a husband!
        The gods would see:  Helen prays, "Hera, I wish for a husband!"
 
The occasional prayer makes for good rp.  Spamming the prayer channel will
get you banned from prayers for a period of time chosen by the immortals.`x

`R     sacrifice (food)`c  -Sends an offering to the gods.
 
Note: Sacrificing on occasion will please the gods, but doing so on an

much like a person who has had too much food to eat, it no longer pleases 
them.`x
