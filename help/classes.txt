text In Athens there are five main classes of people:
 
Slaves are people owned by the government.
   (personally owned slaves are portrayed by mobiles)
 
Citizens own themselves and have special rights and responsibilities.
 
Heroes are Citizens who have gained much experience through trials.
 
Demigods have proven themselves to be the best in all of Greece.
 
Gods are the immortal few who keep the world in order.

text The Athens skill system allows you to fully customise your character,
making him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But be aware that the
skills you pick at character creation are the only skills your character will
start with, you will be able gain other skills during game play though.

When creating skills are paid for with creation points, and the more creation
points you have, the harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost
skills are harder to practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a 
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced 
selection of skills - sometimes at a reduced cost. The experience breakdown
is as follows: 

`GPoints   Exp/lvl     Points   Exp/lvl`=?
  40       1000        90       6000
  50       1500       100       8000
  60       2000       110      12000
  70       3000       120      16000 
  80       4000       130      24000

The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.  Some races
and classes have a minimum Exp/lvl above 1000.

text In 510BC a new way of government was invented in Athens. 'Demokratia', from 
which we get our word 'democracy', means 'rule by the people'. Any man with 
full citizen rights could go to the assembly, where they could speak and vote 
freely. Public debates like this decided how the city was run. 
 
In Athens the mud, players with a class of citizen have some rights that
slaves do not.  There are jobs, quests, and an entire political system only
for citizens.  But with great benefits comes responsibility.
 
Male citizens are required to serve at least two tours with the military.
There are yearly festivals for athletics, drama and religious occasions. The
city pays for these using taxes, but the wealthiest citizens are obliged to
give extra help.
 
Rich citizens consider it an honour to pay for the performers fees in the 
many drama festivals.  Similarly they may have to serve as captains of a
warship for a year, paying the crew and making repairs.
 
Some rich men tried to hide their wealth to get out of their public duties.
Shameful behaviour!

keyword SLAVE SLAVES~
title Slave Class~
category undefined~
text All new players start out with the class of slave.  Slaves are owned by
the government and therefore do not have all of the rights and 
responsibilities that citizens do.  Slaves do not pay taxes.  They are 
limited in their career choices to those jobs that are more labor-intensive.  
Those with the class of slave can purchase homes and own property however.
 
Certain quests may provide a slave with citizenship.  Slaves may also find
ways to purchase their citizenship at a high cost of gold.  Remarkable 
military service or performance in games festivals may also result in a 
slave being granted citizenship.

responsibilities by the government.  They pay taxes on a regular basis.  They
have more career choices then those of the class slave.  Citizens can own
homes and property.  Citizens will find new quests are available to them that
are not given out to slaves.  One must go through citizenship if they want to
ever become a hero.

progressed past the stage of being recognized as a citizen to become one of 
the few outstanding mortals who have accomplished nearly impossible tasks.  
Heroes have all the rights and responsibilities that citizens have.  They 
are not penalized for fleeing combat.
 
To become a hero, a citizen must apply to the remort council.

text Demigods are at the peak of mortal perfection.  They are nearly gods 
themselves, having powers of their own and travel freely in and out of Mount
Olympus.  They are above the need for paying taxes or penalization for
fleeing combat.  They have been a hero not once, but twice.  
 
As per Greek tradition, being judged worthy enough through two hero lives 
is the bare minimum requirement for applying to be a demigod.
