text 1. Using words like 'mob' 'NPC' 'level' in general conversation.  The 
rationale behind this is that if you are actually are an 'Athenian Soldier'
your life would not be based on levels, and your enemies would be real,
not mobs.
 
Bad roleplay  "where can I go to kill some mobs and level?" 
 
A better way: "I am a young adventurer, and in need of excitement.  I 
               Have heard stories of a swamp invested with evil, where
               can I go to dispatch this evil horde."
 
               A lot will depend on your characters, personality.
 
 
2. Using a characters name before you have met them.  An 'Orc Warrior'
or any other person, would not know anyone's name before meeting them.
 
Bad Roleplay: "hi, Jason I've seen you online."
 
A better way: "Greetings sir, I am called Helen. What name are you 
              known by?"
 
 
3. Using the who list or the laston command to find out a players name.
And using that name in conversation is not good roleplay.
 
Bad Roleplay: "Yeah i saw Ajax was on yesterday."
 
A better way: "Has anyone seen a tall human carrying a huge axe?"
 
 
4. Asking or giving information on the ooc channel which is IC.
 
Bad Roleplay: 1. ooc: "Damn Medusa just killed me!"
              2. ooc: "Does anyone know where i can get a good sword?"
              3. ooc: "Ok, I'm going to attack it now, you come in 
                      afterwards."
 
A better way: 1. ooc:  There is no better way.  But you can use any
                       method of communication which is considered IC
                       eg, say, yell, whisper
              2. say:  "Do you have an idea, to where I might find a
                       more suitable sword?"
              3. yell: "Enter once I have given the word!"
 
 
5.  Doing a say or whisper prefixed by ooc:
   
    eg.  'say "OOC: Hi, I'm a from Melbourne."'  
    OR   'say "OOC: sorry, typo."'
 
 
6.  Putting :), :P :|, etc in a say or whisper.
 
 
7   Using emote to blatantly communicate with another character, 
    that does not speak your language.
 
    eg 'emote say "I am Krystin, can you help me."'
    OR 'emote does not understand.'
    OR 'emote wonders if you would like to go to the reeking village.'

text 1. Good roleplay is essentially making decisions and doing actions
   in line with what your character would do, if your character was
   actually in that situation.

   These decisions will be based upon your character's alignment,
   the history you submit, online history, and any other goals 
   you have previously set out for your character.

   Therefore you must control your character in such a manner consistent
   with the above criteria, irrespective of what YOU personally would do
   in that situation.  (Always remember your character is not you.)

   For Example:  A good lawful character, will probably  stand up for
   weaker players even thou that character is likely to die.

   And a chaotic evil player, will probably attack indiscriminately 
   without respect for age, citizenship, class, gender, and strength of
   opponent.

2. Other Examples

   1.  A good aligned player may refuse to use an evil weapon
       because that weapon takes away life.  Even thou that weapon
       may provide an advantage in combat.

   2.  A good aligned player may also refuse to use a cursed, or
       once cursed weapon.  For much the same reasons as 1.

   3.  A lawful aligned player may wish to avoid conflict which is 
       unlawful. eg, stealing, murder, revenge.  A lawful player will 
       look for solutions with in the law.

   4.  A chaotic aligned player will break the law as a means to an
       ends.  A good chaotic aligned character may murder to avenge
       a death.

   5.  An evil aligned player does things which may or may not affect
       others, but there only consideration is for their cause.  An evil
       lawful may bury the dead of their enemies, treat prisoners well,
       and in all respects act honourably within the law, but their 
       overall cause may well harm others.

   6.  A neutral aligned character will tend to be indifferent towards 
       the belief's of another character, but will be influenced by that
	 other character's action.   Evil and good aligned characters, 
       may tend to blinded by their own causes and thus cannot sometimes
       see past another's belief's. 

       Neutral character's have a unique perceptive as they see both
       sides of the coin.
   
   7.  A neutral aligned player might help a good person recover stolen 
       possessions one day, and the next day may steal those possessions
       away. This is very much dependant on a neutral aligned player's 
       tendency (eg lawful or chaotic), which is a very integral part
       of a neutral aligned players personality.

looking at you.  Eg.  "You cringe in horror before this draconian."  It is 
up to the player to decide how they react.  `+

keyword ALIGNMENT-DEFINITION~
category undefined~
text `=?
Alignment is used to represent the values and beliefs that are inside
each Player Character (PC) to help explain why they act the way they do.

This applies to ALL actions performed by EVERY PC - including the
slaying of mobs, talking in the pit, helping other PCs with
advice/equipment, or assisting in Corpse Retrievals (CRs).

The following definitions should be consulted for you to pick the
proper label for the way you plan to act in Athens. Once an
alignment is selected, actions performed outside that alignment
are punishable by alignment changes, loss of experience, and worse -
so choose wisely!  

Role-Playing (RP) means you must learn to keep separate your personal
alignment from that of your character, unless of course you have
chosen to RP a character with the same alignment as yourself.

A high level summary:  Law/Neutral/Chaos is the means and
Good/Neutral/Evil is the result or your actions.

`GLaw vs Chaos
`c------------
The standard Cop versus Criminal philosophical differences.

Law - The belief that in order for happiness and safety to exist, a
set of external laws must be followed and obeyed, regardless of the
consequences.  A lawful character believes that all laws must be
obeyed for society to prosper, including those laws that he does
not agree with.  A lawful person does not tolerate those that break
the law.

Chaos - The belief that laws and strictures restrict the happiness of
an individual, and society will be better off without these
restrictions.  In order for a person to achieve the most in life,
they must not be held back by restrictions imposed by others, and
they should be allowed to do whatever they feel like doing.

Neutral (Law/Chaos) - This is either not being able to understand the
concept of a society's laws [wild animals]; or having a personal set
of laws to live by that are close to that of society, but not identical.
This can be simplified to "Laws are important, but I don't mind breaking
little laws, or breaking laws in small ways".  They are always true
to their own personal set of laws.


`GGood vs Evil
`c------------
Good and Evil are opposites and seek to destroy each other.

Good -  The belief that by being fair, just, and nice to others, one
should receive the same treatment in return.  A good person places
the needs of others before their own needs, and as long as everyone
acts this way, the world will be a better place.  A good person does
NOT tolerate the actions of evil people, because it places the good
person at great risk to have someone around that is selfish and does
not place the needs of others before their own.  Good always seeks to
destroy evil, and never harms other good people.

Evil - Evil people lust for pain and suffering, and feel they must dish
it out, before they get it.  Do unto others BEFORE they do unto you.
The evil person actually enjoys being cruel to others, so has no second
thoughts of performing evil acts for the entertainment value alone.  The
evil person does things solely for their own benefit, always placing
their needs above the needs of others.  Evil people have no difficulty
destroying other evil people, as well as good people, if it benefits them.

Neutral (Good/Evil) - The neutral philosophy advocates that both of
the opposing philosophies of good and evil are too extreme.  A neutral
person is open to all ideas, and either strives to keep a balance between
good and evil, by always siding with the weaker, or treating both sides
equally, thus not endorsing one over the other.

see_also HISTORY EXAMPLE-HISTORY~
text The History is the most important aspect of your character. It is more 
important than attributes, more important than skills and even 
more important than any equipment. You ask why? The reason is pretty 
simple: it is the history that gives your character a meaning, a life of 
its own. 
 
Let us elaborate on that. Role-play means pretending you are someone 
else, in a fantasy, a different, world. Someone that can be totally 
different from you. Tons of fun comes from that. Now, we can only play as 
someone else, if we know that someone. So, we need to know his life, 
what happened to him, how he thinks. In other words, in a way, it is 
more important to describe how your character means than where he was 
born, or who killed his mother. How did he feel in the most important 
moments of his life? How will he act now? Those are the questions you 
should think when you are writing about your character.

A history does not have to be long, though a one paragraph history will 
hardly say much about your character. A history should be as long as you 
think is necessary to describe your character's way of thinking. And 
that is as important to you as it is to us.
 
Let me give you an example to illustrate what I mean:
 
A history that says 'I was born in a poor village, saw my parents be 
killed by gorgons, and left to explore the world' can have many different 
meanings. One, your character might hate gorgons now, for what they did. 
Second, he may love them, if his parents were such monsters that their 
deaths were a blessing to your character. Three, he may have suffered 
with his parents deaths, but then he realized his parents left him an 
enormous inheritance and, ah, well, pity they died, but life goes on.
With that example, I hope to have shown you that your character 
psychology is what makes a difference between your character and another 
player's character. As you describe how your character think, his actions, 
alignment begins to make a lot more sense. Often, it is the history that 
defines his alignment, that retouches it, and explains why someone is 
evil, good, lawful or chaotic.

Thus, a History's purpose is to tell, not only us, but you too, who your 
character really is. Its purpose is to help you make a full character, 
with some idiosyncrasies of his own, and allow you to have the most 
possible fun with him. Its purpose is to make your character more than a 
bunch of bytes.

- Define your character's personality. Go deeper than alignments, add 
idiosyncrasies, quirks, and the kind (help history-info).
- Your character must have a life goal, everyone does. It may be simple or 
complex, but he/she must have a reason to live. Revenge as a character's 
only goal should be avoided, since that is a short-termed goal, and usually 
a side one.
- A history has a minimum requirement of 30 lines (around 400 words).
- Your character should be active in your history - do not keep him/her 
sitting, watching events happen before him/her.
- Work out your character's interests. Think of hobbies, work, and what else 
he/she does in life apart from killing mobs. Do not kill your character of 
boredom by keeping him studying skills non-stop all his life.
- Unless there is a good reason to, you should know your city, and some of
its mythos (help city).
- All characters are born in Greece, in one of the existing city-states 
(help city-states). Your character cannot come from other worlds, or 
fictitious realms. You can choose one of the main cities (help cities) of 
Greece, or think of a small village, which you can name as you see fit.
- Unless there is a reason not to, your character has a home, a place he/she 
came from.
- You cannot destroy your character hometown, by any means.
- All Greek major gods are in help gods. Do not "create" new gods in your 
histories, and treat them as if the whole of Greece follows them. If you 
want to have a particular view of the world, talk to an immortal prior to 
writing your history.
- Keep in mind that your beginning is humble. Most don't know you, so you 
are not a great hero in these parts of the world. Also, you cannot be a 
king, prince, emperor, or any ruler of any part of the world. Nor the child 
of a god, nor the favorite worshipper of a god/dess. If you want to be 
something, build that out IC.
- Grammar is not a requirement, and you need not be a great writer.

 By becoming a quester, you are telling us that you want to be part of 
quests and autoquests, no matter how dangerous they can be.  No matter if it 
takes you to cold death.  And that you will have fun, even then.  `+
 `+
 Some mobs, within dangerous autoquests, will only recognize and react to 
questers.  All non-questers will be magnanimously ignored by them.  
Immortals running quests that may lead to some sort of loss will check if 
you are a quester, before taking you to danger.  Some autoquests will not
be able to be done by non questers.  And the immortals will have less 
tendency to actively promote questing with non questers when players
that are questers are logged on.`+
 `+
 Non-questers will be respected (by both mobs and immortals) in their wish 
to not be involved in any quest that may harm them in some way.  `+
 `+
 Be careful, once this status is turned on, it cannot be turned off!  And 
to get it removed will cost you at least `#`R-5000xp`^.  `+
 `+
 Thus, do not take the decision of becoming a quester lightly.   `+

When creating your character, you will surely imagine him/her with a specific 
personality, with quirks, and an original way to see the world. You might also 
imagine him/her with some interesting physical attributes that will add some 
spice to your roleplay.
 
This list of traits is here to help you choose those special aspects of your 
character. They are mainly suggestions, you are free to think of new ideas, as 
far as they are consistent with our settings (fantasy, medieval one). If you 
wish to discuss any new ideas, send a `#`Wnote to rp`^.
 
As you will see, some of the traits have alignment restrictions. That means if 
you have one of those, you cannot choose that trait. Some of them may not be 
strictly in accord with your own view of that trait - human psycology is 
complex after all - but that's how they will be treated in this game.
 
In order to be letgained, you will have to choose at least 3 traits. 
50% (rounded up) of your traits must be personality traits.

`+
Once created, extended descriptions can be edited much the same way as 
extra descriptions.  The syntax is: `+
`+
OEXTENDED object mode keyword ...`+
`+
Where mode can be: `+
`#`yadd clear copy edit remove rename tag`^ `+

`#`=? add - adds a new keyword with empty description.  `+
`=? appendkey - appends keywords to existing keywords `+
`=? clear - clears ALL extended description on an object!  `+

`=? edit - puts you into the description editor for keyword.  `+
`=? remove - removes an extended description.  `+
`=? rename - renames keyword to new keyword.  `^ `+
`+
Thus, to create a new extended description: `+
`+
`#`Woextended object name add blue`^ `+
`+
A keyword can be more than one word, just put the words between '' (use 
the 'x y' syntax).  `+
`+
After creating the keywords, you can edit the description the same way you 
do with extra descriptions, using the `#`yedit`^ mode.  `+
`+
The mode `#`yremane`^ replaces all former keywords, by the new one(s).  Once 
again, if more than one new keyword, put them between ''.  `+
`+
`#`=? `#`Woextended <object name> add 'blue flower'`^ `+
`=? --> adds one extended description with the keywords 'blue' and `+
`=? 'flower.  `+
`=? `#`Woextended <object name> rename blue 'white scepter'`^ `+
`=? --> changes the keywords of the extended description from 'blue and `+
`=? 'flower' to 'white' and 'scepter' `^ `+
`+
When copying an extended description, you cannot put more than one 
keywords into the copied description, so you need to `#`yappend`^ new keywords 
afterward.`+

title Short Description~
category undefined~
text A short description is what people will see when they walk in the room.  
It is how you will appear to everyone else.  To this end it is very 
important, it is preferred that you have a long description before you 
get a short description, but sometimes an imm might offer to set your
short before you have a long.  DO NOT ask for a short description until
you have written or atleast attempted to write a long description 
(see help long for more on long descriptions).
 
SHORT DESCRIPTION RULES:
* Must show your gender.
* A short description cannot include information about your behaviour 
or how you react to a particular player.
* No clothing in a short description since that is seen in your equipment
list when someone looks at you.  Changing clothes would cause your short
to be incorrect then.
 
Examples of good short descriptions:
A tall and slender man
A dark-skinned woman with flowing black hair
 
If you are at level 10 and only have a generic short description, the
command REQUESTLETGAIN will change it for you automatically when your
request is approved.  If for some reason, you are at level 10 or past
that point and need to change your short, you may ask an immortal to
change it for you.  Beware that constantly asking to change your short
will result in your short-change request being refused.
 
`CNOTE:`c You do not need to add a comma to the end of your short.
The mud will automatically put a comma after your short when someone
looks in the room and sees you.

keyword STORY BACKGROUND CREATION~
title Background Story~

text . 
Gaea, the Earth goddess and the eldest of the gods, emerged out of Chaos and 
gave birth as she slept to her son, Uranus - the Sky god. He showered 
fertile rain upon her secret clefts as he gazed down fondly upon her from 
the mountains, and she bore grass, flowers, trees, and birthed the 
astounding array of birds and beasts to populate them. The fertile rain of 
Uranus also made the rivers flow and lakes and seas came into being when the 
hollow places filled with water.
 
She mated with her son and husband Uranus to produce the Titans. First came 
the hundred-handed Hecatoncheires, the giants and three one-eyed Cyclopes. 
But their relationship was so passionate, and the embrace of Uranus and Gaea 
(Sky and Earth) was so overwhelming, that their offspring could not emerge 
from her womb.
 
You see, Uranus was afraid that one of his Titan children would end up 
overthrowing him and taking over rule of the Universe. The Titans were thus 
imprisoned by Uranus in Tartarus, a region of the Underworld. 
 
This caused Mother Earth great grief, so she conceived a sharp sickle that 
one of her children, Cronus, used to severe his father's genitals. The god 
Uranus was emasculated and the Sky separated from the Earth. From the blood 
of Uranus that fell on her, Gaea conceived the Eirynes, the avenging 
goddesses who pursued and punished murderers and evil-doers.
 
Uranus thus faded from the mythological scene and Cronus married his sister 
Rhea, becoming supreme ruler of the Universe. This was regarded by the 
Greeks as the Golden Age of the Titans. But Cronus was just as paranoid as 
his father, and, heeding the warning of an oracle, in turn he swallowed all 
the children he fathered with his wife Rhea, afraid that they would do to 
him as he did to Uranus.
 
On the advice of Gaea, Rhea gave Cronus  a stone wrapped in baby blankets, 
and the gullible Cronus "swallowed" the ruse, instead of his baby boy Zeus. 
The child was secretly taken to the island of Crete and raised  by the 
Nymphs. Eventually Zeus grew up to free his swallowed siblings and with 
their help indeed overthrew Cronus and became the supreme Olympian.
