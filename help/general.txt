title Color Preferences~
category undefined~
text `=lSyntax:`=? colour <options>`+
`+
The colour system is extremely flexible, and allows the reassignment of over 
120 different colour allocations within the game (using the '`=Ccolour show`=?' 
and '`=Ccolour set`=?' commands).  In addition it supports mud wide colour 
templates which you can easily switch to then customize (`=Ccolour use`=?).`+
`#`+
The colour prefix 'escape character' to specify a colour is the left handed 
brace '``', following that you should use one of the following letters,`+
`=?      `R``R`r``r     red     `C``C`c``c     cyan`+
`=?      `G``G`g``g     green   `Y``Y`y``y     yellow`+
`=?      `B``B`b``b     blue    `W``W`=?``=?    white`+
`=?      `M``M`m``m     magenta `X``X`=?``=?    clear(reset colour)`+
`=?      `=?``?       `?`#random  `=?```-       tilde character`=?`+
`=?      `=?``#       save    `^``^       restore`=?`+
`+
Use a capital letter for a highlighted version of a colour.`+
`+
Example: ``#``CYay!``^ will give you `#`CYay!`^`+
`+
If you want more than one colour, you start the colour change  with ``# and 
change the other colours within the text. You end  it with ``^.`+
`=? Example: I love ``?colours. ``#``=?Yes, ``YI ``=?do ``Mlove ``^them.``=?`+
`=?          I love `?colours. `#`=?Yes, `YI `=?do `Mlove `^them.`+
`+
`=?Notice that in the above example, the word 'colours' is a random colour, 
and the word 'them' is the same colour... this is because the random colour 
(made with `Y``?`=?) was saved with the `Y``#`=? code then restored with the `Y``^`=? code.`+
`+
If you are used to using another colour prefix character, you can change 
your prefix using the '`=Ccolour prefix`=?' command.`+
`+
For a complete list of the colour commands available to you, type `=Ccolour`=? 
by itself.

text As a hero you are entitled to have a limited version of the restring command.
This is a very great privilage, and should not be taken lightly.
 
Along with privilage comes responsibility, as a hero your responsibiliies in 
reguards to restringing are.  
 
 
1.  You will only do restrings for yourself, in NO circumstances can you 
restring for someone else.  The one exception to this is if you restring an 
item which is of type trash or clothing, something that has NO value
abilities. 
It must be basically useless.  And this is then used for some type of
roleplay ie, restringing a trash item like a vulpine pelt into a Leather vest. 
In this  case you may give a restring away, but you MUST send a note to
immortal saying you have done it.
 
2.  You will not restring any item into anything that is ooc in any way, and 
you will make sure that anything you restring is of a high quality. Objects
should not have names in their shorts. ie. The Immense sword of
Annihilation, or the Shield of Takhisis. Each object should ideally only
describe its physical appearance in both its short and long. Name keywords
too should be appropriate for that object.
Those objects in the game that do have names, etc, in their descriptions,
are a)either immortal-created items, or b)items approved by the immortals. 
 
3.  NO restringing of artifacts, or other important items. ie. Restringing an
enemies sword, or a roleplay item.
 
4.  Finally if restring is abused in any way we have forseen or have not
forseen it will be immediately removed without the possibility for you to
get it back.
 
5.  If you want to use colours, make sure you understand how the colour code 
works (`#`Chelp `=_colour`^).
 
6. Restrings must be within our setting. So, no 'Saberlights'.
 
7. Do not use names/descriptions from other fantasy worlds, such as 'Sword of 
Takhisis'.

keyword WEIGHT ENCUMBERANCE ITEMS~
category undefined~
text `=?
As a basic estimate 100 gold coins are four times as heavy as silver coins
(25 to the pound, as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  Weight is 
the measure of the total weight you can carry.

Encumberance is different from weight, for example you may easily be able 
to carry a pack full of lead if it say weighs 80 kilos.  The total weight
is all contained in the pack it isn't bulky and doesn't encumber you.  On 
the other hand you may struggle more trying to carry 20 lightweight but 30
foot long poles.  Even though the poles weigh less than the lead, they are 
harder to carry as they get in the way when moving etc.  Encumberance is a
measure of how restricting an item is.

To this end deaths from `rmobs`=? are not permanent.  Deaths from players will be

their soul is purged of karns before their spirit is forced to depart 
forever.  Each mortal is gifted by the gods of all, 3 rebirths or (Karn's). `+

As spend more time in the realm, your chances of regaining karns increases

amount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less 
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the 
ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

keyword SUBLEVELS SUBPRACS SUBTRAINS SUBPRACTICES SUB-LEVELS~
category undefined~
text The Sublevel system if enabled on comes into affect at level 50.`+
`+
The sublevel system was introduced so we could make xp above level 50 easier 
for killing things, depending on what level but xp can be 10times higher, 
some times even more if you level 80 or more.  Reaching hero is now harder 
for sure, but on the bright side there is a chance for new players coming to 
have a chance of not getting killed of because the cost of dying is so much 
higher a higher level player is going to be less likely to risk killing you 
off and at the same time it takes a lot more work to get a huge level 
advantage in combat.  `+
`+
Each level 50 and above requires you to first complete 1 or more sublevels.  
The sublevels required for that level are shown in your score which becomes 
visible once reaching 50.  If you had say 2 sublevels for a level (as is the 
case for a level 54 player), you would first have to gain the equivalent 
amount of xp to gain a level 3 times before reaching level 54.  The first 
level worth of XP will raise your sublevel from 0/2 to 1/2.  The second to 
2/2, and then the next level worth will gain your actual level.  `+
`+
A system of subtrains and subpracs has also been added, how this works is 
each sublevel you gain a subprac or subtrain, when your subpracs reaches 2 
you get an additional practice to use and your subprac is set to 0, 
subtrains work the same but requiring 5 subtrains per train.  `+
`+
Once you start gaining sublevels you will lose 500xp + (250* the number of 
sublevels for your level)`+
Some number examples:`+
-- LEVEL --- Sublevel per level --- calculation ------------- xp lost ---`+
    51        1                   500+ (250*1) = 500+ 250  =  750xp lost`+
    58        3                   500+ (250*3) = 500+ 750  = 1250xp lost`+
    73        6                   500+ (250*6) = 500+1500  = 2000xp lost`+
`+
You don't lose subpracs and subtrains for dying as the loss is considered 
enough without more losses.  If you flee and lose a sublevel you will also`+
lose the subtrains and subpracs you just got.  If you lose a level, then you 
have most of the sublevels required to relevel.`+
`+
The number of sublevels are required per level depends on the level, here is 
a basic guide of the requirements at this stage, these may be changed:`+
`+
Sublevels for level in range`+
1 50-54`+
2 55-57`+
3 58-60`+
4 61-65`+
5 66-70`+
6 71-75`+
7 76-80`+
8 81-85`+
9 86-89`+

text Military Points (MPS) are a representation of your fighting prowess.  They 
stand for how well you are capable of serving an army.  There are several 
ways that mps are gained and lost.  The most important and common two are 
discussed here.
 
A single mps can be gained from the Army Flag Quest.  This quest is a large, 
inter-city-state game of capture the flag.  If you successfully capture the 
flag of another city and fly it on your city's pole, you will be given one 
military point.
 
Military points are also given through the defeat of an opponent who is also 
enlisted.  If you kill an enlisted player, you will gain approximately one 
quarter of his mps.  In turn, he will lose approximately one quarter of all 
of his mps upon that death.  Those who have more military worth are 
considered larger targets and represent a tougher enemy to beat, hence their 
higher mps value.
 
Civilians and enlisted players alike can win and lose military points 
through defeat and victory in the arena.
 
If you take a military token off the body of an enemy guard (or off an enemy
who has killed a guard) and return it to your army headquarters, there will
be an officer who will `REXCHANGE`c it for a military point.

spending at least 6 hours on at a time.
