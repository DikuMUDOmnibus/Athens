After 15 seconds have past in the mooting process, the autovote system 
becomes enabled.
 
If the moot concerned is for an amount less than the value you have your 
autovote set to, the code will not wait for you to vote before attempting 
to resolve the moot.  The only time a moot will pass in a time less than 15
seconds is if there is only one noble online - in other words they called a
moot and there isnt any other nobles around to vote on it.
 
Your current autovote value can be seen using the worth command.
 
`CNote: `XAutovote only has affect on moots that are positive in value and 
of type reward.
