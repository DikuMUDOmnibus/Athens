confident air.  Lush greens cover the hills, growing with much gusto.  Rocks 
jut out here and there in the hills, rounding out the breath-taking visual 
spectacular.

Name Cypress Forest~
Desc Thick grass carpets the ground below, but as it grows closer to the dark 
Forest, it too shies away.  Young cypress trees, yearning to be as tall as 
the ones beyond them, mark the outskirts of this great forest.  The 
evergreen leaves of these short, stubby cypress trees seem to be their only 
connection to their gargantuan relatives to the south.  A few trees, 
appearing to be mere shrubs, grow awkwardly here.  Much beyond these young 
trees, however, all is dark, as well, making this wood quite foreboding.  It 
also seems to be the home of many animals, with birds twittering and rodents 
chattering.  There appears to be some sort of make-shift trail leading 
through the trees, beckoning you to follow.

ExtraDesc trail ~
This trail seems to be nothing more than the path of wild animals passed over many times. It is very narrow, only one traveller may walk through at a time. Looking ahead, it appears there are times when bushes cover the trail and you will have to force your way through.
~
ExtraDesc tree ~
These cypress trees, though young, have been here for many years. They are growing straight and tall, with long branches which divide into six fronds. On each frond, there are many small, scaley leaves. This evergreen does not lose all of its leaves when the season changes, but it does lose some. It also grows cones on the ends of the fronds which hold the seeds it hopes to spread to increase the size of this magnificent forest.

appearing to be mere shrubs, grow awkwardly here.  Much beyond these young 
trees, however, all is dark, as well, making this wood quite foreboding.  It 
also seems to be the home of many animals, with birds twittering and rodents 
chattering.  There appears to be some sort of make-shift trail leading 
through the trees, beckoning you to follow.

ExtraDesc trees ~
These cypress trees, though young, have been here for many years. They are growing straight and tall, with long branches which divide into six fronds. On each frond, there are many small, scaley leaves. This evergreen does not lose all of its leaves when the season changes, but it does lose some. It also grows cones on the ends of the fronds which hold the seeds it hopes to spread to increase the size of this magnificent forest.

Name Northern Beaches of Crete~
Desc The earth rises from the stunning blue water of the sea with grace and 
splendor, beginning with brown sands formed into a soft cushion by the 
never-ending tides.  The sandy beach continues several meters into the 
shore.  To the far south of the beach, grass sprouts up out of the sandy 
ground, growing timidly at first and then with more gusto, until it covers 
the entire land.

Name Within the Cypress Forest~
Desc A thick stand of cypress trees grow here, stretching diligently toward the 
sky.  Old cones lie scattered on the ground at the knees of the trees, 
perhaps they will find purchase and grow the next go round.  The ground is 
covered with the scaley-leaves that dropped off last season.  These trees 
are quite tall, although they are still not the oldest of the Forest, but 
merely middle-aged.  The sky is nearly completely blocked out by the upper 
reaches of the trees, making this area quite dark.  Beautiful blossoms mark 
the undergrowth and bring color to this dark area.  There appears to be some 
sort of make-shift trail leading through the trees, beckoning you to follow.

Name Cypress Forest~
Desc Thick grass carpets the ground below, but as it grows closer to the dark 
Forest, it too shies away.  Young cypress trees, yearning to be as tall as 
the ones beyond them, mark the outskirts of this great forest.  The 
evergreen leaves of these short, stubby cypress trees seem to be their only 
connection to their gargantuan relatives to the east.  A few trees, 
appearing to be mere shrubs, grow awkwardly here.  Much beyond these young 
trees, however, all is dark, as well, making this wood quite foreboding.  It 
also seems to be the home of many animals, with birds twittering and rodents 
chattering.  There appears to be some sort of make-shift trail leading

Name Within the Cypress Forest~
Desc A thick stand of cypress trees grow here, stretching diligently toward the 
sky.  Old cones lie scattered on the ground at the knees of the trees, 
perhaps they will find purchase and grow the next go round.  The ground is 
covered with the scaley-leaves that dropped off last season.  These trees 
are quite tall, although they are still not the oldest of the Forest, but 
merely middle-aged.  The sky is nearly completely blocked out by the upper 
reaches of the trees, making this area quite dark.  A small rabbit's burrow 
seems to be at the base of one of these trees.  There appears to be some 
sort of make-shift trail leading through the trees, beckoning you to follow.

Name Cypress Forest~
Desc Thick grass carpets the ground below, but as it grows closer to the dark 
Forest, it too shies away.  Young cypress trees, yearning to be as tall as 
the ones beyond them, mark the outskirts of this great forest.  The 
evergreen leaves of these short, stubby cypress trees seem to be their only 
connection to their gargantuan relatives to the west.  A few trees, 
appearing to be mere shrubs, grow awkwardly here.  Much beyond these young 
trees, however, all is dark, as well, making this wood quite foreboding.  It 
also seems to be the home of many animals, with birds twittering and rodents 
chattering.  There appears to be some sort of make-shift trail leading

Name Deep Within the Cypress Forest~
Desc Dense patches of cypress trees grow firm and tall here.  Looking up, the 
trees seem to reach nearly fifty feet in the air with their evergreen 
branches swaying gently by unseen breezes.  The leaves of yesteryear have 
dropped to the floor of the forest and provide a soft carpet, quieting all 
footsteps and seemingly all sounds.  Small bushes bearing flowers and 
berries grow along the ground, offering bits of color in this otherwise dark 
place.  Animal trails can be seen leading off into the trees, some decidely 
with purpose and some seemingly created on a whim.  Traipsing deeper into 
the forest, this locale seems opportune to hide something of deep 
significance.  The quiet atmosphere mums all noises, perfect for hiding...

These cypress trees have been here for quite a few decades. They are growing straight and tall, with long branches which divide into six fronds. On each frond, there are many small, scaley leaves. This evergreen does not lose all of its leaves when the season changes, but it does lose some. It also grows cones on the ends of the fronds which hold the seeds it hopes to spread to increase the size of this magnificent forest.

Name Within the Cypress Forest~
Desc A thick stand of cypress trees grow here, stretching diligently toward the 
sky.  Old cones lie scattered on the ground at the knees of the trees, 
perhaps they will find purchase and grow the next go round.  The ground is 
covered with the scaley-leaves that dropped off last season.  These trees 
are quite tall, although they are still not the oldest of the Forest, but 
merely middle-aged.  The sky is nearly completely blocked out by the upper 
reaches of the trees, making this area quite dark.  A small rabbit's burrow 
seems to be at the base of one of these trees.  There appears to be some 
sort of make-shift trail leading through the trees, beckoning you to follow.

Desc Thick grass carpets the ground below, but as it grows closer to the dark

the ones beyond them, mark the outskirts of this great forest.  The 
evergreen leaves of these short, stubby cypress trees seem to be their only

appearing to be mere shrubs, grow awkwardly here.  Much beyond these young

Name Northern Beaches of Crete~
Desc The earth rises from the stunning blue water of the sea with grace and 
splendor, beginning with brown sands formed into a soft cushion by the 
never-ending tides.  The sandy beach continues several meters into the 
shore.  To the far south of the beach, beautiful hills rise up in a 
confident air.  Lush greens cover the hills, growing with much gusto.  Rocks 
jut out here and there in the hills, rounding out the breath-taking visual 
spectacular.  Far to the west, you can see majestic moutains standing boldly 
on the horizon.

Name Cypress Forest~
Desc Thick grass carpets the ground below, but as it grows closer to the dark 
Forest, it too shies away.  Young cypress trees, yearning to be as tall as 
the ones beyond them, mark the outskirts of this great forest.  The 
evergreen leaves of these short, stubby cypress trees seem to be their only 
connection to their gargantuan relatives to the north.  A few trees, 
appearing to be mere shrubs, grow awkwardly here.  Much beyond these young 
trees, however, all is dark, as well, making this wood quite foreboding.  It 
also seems to be the home of many animals, with birds twittering and rodents 
chattering.  There appears to be some sort of make-shift trail leading 
through the trees, beckoning you to follow.

Name Cypress Forest in Crete~
Desc Thick grass carpets the ground below, but as it grows closer to the dark 
Forest, it too shies away.  Young cypress trees, yearning to be as tall as 
the ones beyond them, mark the outskirts of this great forest.  The 
evergreen leaves of these short, stubby cypress trees seem to be their only 
connection to their gargantuan relatives to the east.  A few trees, 
appearing to be mere shrubs, grow awkwardly here.  Much beyond these young 
trees, however, all is dark, as well, making this wood quite foreboding.  It 
also seems to be the home of many animals, with birds twittering and rodents 
chattering.  There appears to be some sort of make-shift trail leading 
through the trees, beckoning you to follow.
