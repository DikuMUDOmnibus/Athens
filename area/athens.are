She was a Naiad, the daughter of the rivergod Triton, and both she and
Athena were raised to love to fight. One time when theywere dueling,
Zeus mischievously heldup the aegis. Pallas looked away for only a
moment, but that was enough, and she fell and died. Athena was
distraught.  In her grief and remorse, she made a wooden statue of her
friend and put Pallas' name before her own. Athena was thereafter
known as Pallas Athena.`x

Name Theatre of Dionysus~
Desc Cut into the rocky ground, rows of large step-like stadium seats surround a 
simple stage.  The shape of the stadium is reminiscent of a sea shell and 
the round stage the obvious pearl, seeking the audience's attentions.  This 
stage boasts all of the latest technology including a skene hut for 
backgrounds and actors to change in as well as the Aeorema, Periactoi and 
the Ekeclema machines.  Directly infront of the stage is the orchestra for 
the chorus.

ExtraDesc machine machines Aeorema Periactoi Ekeclema~
.   `cInside the permanent skene, are machines. One machine, the Aeorema, is a 
crane that enabled the gods and flying creatures to appear on the stage. 
Another machine, the Periactoi, is placed inside pillars on the left and 
right side of the stage. It changes the background of the skene. The last 
machine is the Ekeclema, a platform on wheels to bring the bodies of the 
dead out to show the audience. This is necessary since murder and suicide 
never take place in front of the audience. 
~
ExtraDesc chorus orchestra~
.  `cThe orchestra is the main part of the stage where the chorus is located 
at. The word orchestra is derived from the word orcheisthai. Literally 
translated, it means the dancing place. It is the place where the chorus 
dance and sing. During the harvesting season it is used for threshing. 
Threshing is the beating of wheat to remove the grain. The orchestra is in 
front of the skene and is at the center of the theatre. It has the thymeli 
in it, which began as an altar, but later became the place for the chorus 
leader, the korypharios, to stand.
