Name Southern Gate~
Desc Built into the interior of the wall, this southern gate's controls for 
operation are hidden inside for protection.  The massive iron doors are 
closed tightly against the pressure of the outside world.  Even after 
centuries of being closed, they are still fully operative and have been 
taken well care of and serviced on a regular basis.  Another door, again 
solid iron only much smaller, is set into the wall and stands open letting 
the guardsmen free access into the bowels of the wall so they may take their 
positions in silent duty.

Name Divergence in the Road ~
Desc This cross section of the Way of Kings, Way of Grains and Way of Labor and 
Industry contains a large fountain with water billowing from the top to 
splash into the containment basin, available for all to drink.  High above, 
a large metal V is held in place by huge linked chains with enough clearance 
for most anything to pass beneath.  In time of war, the mechanism is lowered 
to cut off the main road leaving such a narrow channel that the enemy is 
forced to advance singly, on foot, left and right, keeping them diverged 
from the Palace.

taken well care of and serviced on a regular basis.  Another door, again 
solid iron only much smaller, is set into the wall and stands open letting 
the guardsmen free access into the bowels of the wall so they may take their 
positions in silent duty.

Name Western Gate ~
Desc Built into the interior of the wall, this western gate's controls for 
operation are hidden inside for protection.  The massive iron doors are 
closed tightly against the pressure of the outside world.  Even after 
centuries of being closed, they are still fully operative and have been 
taken well care of and serviced on a regular basis.  Another door, again 
solid iron only much smaller, is set into the wall and stands open letting 
the guardsmen free access into the bowels of the wall so they may take their 
positions in silent duty.
