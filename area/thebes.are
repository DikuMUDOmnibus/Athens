Name Forest Nearing Thebes~
Desc The density of trees seems to lessen in a south-easterly direction.  The air 
here is occasionally ripe with a fresh smell distinctly different from the 
heavy perfume of the inner forest.  The trees that create the canopy 
overhead are not yet at their full maturity, allowing a view of towering 
walls to peek through the openings between their young and well-spaced 
foliage.

here is occasionally ripe with a fresh smell distinctly different from the 
heavy perfume of the inner forest.  The trees that create the canopy 
overhead are not yet at their full maturity, allowing a view of towering 
walls to peek through the openings between their young and well-spaced 
foliage.

Name Forest Nearing Thebes~
Desc The density of trees seems to lessen in a south-easterly direction.  The air 
here is occasionally ripe with a fresh smell distinctly different from the 
heavy perfume of the inner forest.  The trees that create the canopy 
overhead are not yet at their full maturity, allowing a view of towering 
walls to peek through the openings between their young and well-spaced 
foliage.

Name Rustic Path Around The Walls~
Desc Trodden by countless footfalls and horses, this simple path winds its way 
around the city of Thebes.  The path here is wide, allowing ample room for 
carts, horses, and people to pass with ease.  There is no space between the 
walking trail and the city wall next to which it is pressed.  The fabled 
wall of Thebes stands surprisingly vertical and impenetrable.  Only the 
seven gates allow access.

Name Forest Nearing Thebes~
Desc The density of trees seems to lessen in a south-easterly direction.  The air 
here is occasionally ripe with a fresh smell distinctly different from the 
heavy perfume of the inner forest.  The trees that create the canopy 
overhead are not yet at their full maturity, allowing a view of towering 
walls to peek through the openings between their young and well-spaced 
foliage.

Name Rustic Path Around The Walls~
Desc Trodden by countless footfalls and horses, this simple path winds its way 
around the city of Thebes.  The path here is wide, allowing ample room for 
carts, horses, and people to pass with ease.  There is no space between the 
walking trail and the city wall next to which it is pressed.  The fabled 
wall of Thebes stands surprisingly vertical and impenetrable.  Only the 
seven gates allow access.

Name Rustic Path Around The Walls~
Desc Trodden by countless footfalls and horses, this simple path winds its way 
around the city of Thebes.  The path here is wide, allowing ample room for 
carts, horses, and people to pass with ease.  There is no space between the 
walking trail and the city wall next to which it is pressed.  The fabled 
wall of Thebes stands surprisingly vertical and impenetrable.  Only the 
seven gates allow access.

Name Agora~
Desc A basket-weave pattern has been created from the stones laid out upon the 
smooth ground here.  The wide, and open marketplace serves as a political 
hot-spot and a commercial trade zone.  Trees grow in square, stone boxes.

protective wall.

Name Rustic Path Around The Walls~
Desc Trodden by countless footfalls and horses, this simple path winds its way 
around the city of Thebes.  The path here is wide, allowing ample room for 
carts, horses, and people to pass with ease.  There is no space between the 
walking trail and the city wall next to which it is pressed.  The fabled 
wall of Thebes stands surprisingly vertical and impenetrable.  Only the 
seven gates allow access.

Desc The density of trees seems to lessen in a northern direction.  The air here 
is occasionally ripe with a fresh smell distinctly different from the heavy 
perfume of the inner forest.  The trees that create the canopy overhead are 
not yet at their full maturity, allowing a view of towering walls to peek 
through the openings between their young and well-spaced foliage.

Name Rustic Path Around The Walls~
Desc Trodden by countless footfalls and horses, this simple path winds its way 
around the city of Thebes.  The path here is wide, allowing ample room for 
carts, horses, and people to pass with ease.  There is no space between the 
walking trail and the city wall next to which it is pressed.  The fabled 
wall of Thebes stands surprisingly vertical and impenetrable.  Only the 
seven gates allow access.
