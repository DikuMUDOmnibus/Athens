Greetings,

You may be wondering why such a large world that has so much time and effort put into it is suddenly up for grabs.
Athens was a grande experiment that Zeus and myself strived to keep alive for so very long but that has for a
variety of reasons sat untouched and uncompleted.  I've heard that there is nothing worse than a mud whose staff
has spent thousands of hours working on to end up being burnt to a cd and placed in a jewel case to collect dust
on a shelf.  I agree, what a waste!  While Athens is not at all perfect and not done (muds never truly are) I am
sure that anyone willing to take the time to look at it and dig into the many areas and coding modifications
would find an intriguing world worth expanding.  It is, after all the world of ancient Greek Mythology where
your players are truly heroes.

Any support needed for this code should be first sought out at the Dawn of Time website:  www.dawnoftime.org and
its useful forum http://forum.dawnoftime.org as it has been so long since I have personally delved into the code
and am presumably useless in most matters.  If however you're looking for creative advice or have questions on
how the world of Athen was developing and growing, those questions I can answer as that world is most firmly
planted in the back of my mind.

Best of luck to all who find this code useful.
